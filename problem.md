### **1. Core Logic & Algorithm**

This problem can be modeled as finding the shortest path in an unweighted state graph, for which the optimal algorithm is **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. The state in our graph is defined by the tuple `(k, x, y)`, representing the number of orbs collected, the current x-coordinate, and the current y-coordinate. BFS is ideal because it explores the state graph layer by layer, where each layer corresponds to an increasing number of dance moves, naturally guaranteeing that the first time we reach a state with exactly `T` orbs, it will be with the minimum possible number of moves.

### **2. State Representation / Data Structures**

1.  **`min_moves[k][x_idx][y_idx]` (3D Array):** This is the core data structure, effectively a DP table or distance array. `min_moves[k][x_idx][y_idx]` will store the minimum number of dance moves required to collect exactly `k` orbs, ending at coordinate `(x, y)`. We'll initialize all entries to infinity (`-1` or a very large number) to signify they are unreached.
    *   `k`: Orbs collected, from `0` to `T`. Size `T+1`.
    *   `x_idx`, `y_idx`: Since coordinates can be negative (`[-50, 50]`), we map them to non-negative array indices using an offset (e.g., `x_idx = x + 50`). This makes the index range `[0, 100]` for a total size of 101 for each dimension.

2.  **`q` (Queue):** A standard queue to manage the states to be visited by the BFS. It will store tuples of `(k, x, y)`, representing the states that have been reached and whose neighbors need to be explored.

3.  **`f_values[x_idx][y_idx]` (2D Array):** A helper 2D array to pre-store the given `f(x,y)` values for efficient `O(1)` lookup. This table will be populated based on the `X_MIN, Y_MIN, X_MAX, Y_MAX` input, using the same coordinate offset system as the `min_moves` table.

### **3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

1.  **Coordinate & F-Table Setup:**
    *   Define a constant `OFFSET` (e.g., `50`) to map world coordinates `(x, y)` to array indices `(x + OFFSET, y + OFFSET)`.
    *   Read `N`, `T`, and the `N` dance routines.
    *   Read the bounds `X_MIN, Y_MIN, X_MAX, Y_MAX` and the grid of `f(x,y)` values. Populate your `f_values` 2D array. The lookup function for `f(x, y)` should return the value from this table if `(x,y)` is within the given bounds, and `0` otherwise.

2.  **Initialization:**
    *   Initialize the `min_moves` 3D array with an infinity value (e.g., -1) to mark all states as unvisited.
    *   Set the base case: We start at `(0,0)` with 0 orbs after 0 moves. Set `min_moves[0][0 + OFFSET][0 + OFFSET] = 0`.
    *   Initialize the queue `q` and add the starting state: `q.push({k=0, x=0, y=0})`.

3.  **BFS Main Loop:**
    *   Loop while the queue `q` is not empty.
    *   Dequeue the front state: `current_k, current_x, current_y`.
    *   Let `current_moves = min_moves[current_k][current_x + OFFSET][current_y + OFFSET]`.

4.  **Transition Logic (Inside the loop):**
    *   For each of the `N` dance routines `i` (from `1` to `N`):
        a.  Calculate the orbs gained: `orb_gain = B_i + lookup_f(current_x, current_y)`.
        b.  Calculate the new orb total: `next_k = current_k + orb_gain`.
        c.  If `next_k > T`, this path overshoots the target. Continue to the next dance routine.
        d.  Calculate the next position: `next_x = current_x + dx_i`, `next_y = current_y + dy_i`.
        e.  Check coordinate bounds: If `next_x` or `next_y` fall outside the valid range (e.g., `[-50, 50]`), this move is invalid. Continue to the next dance routine.
        f.  Check for a shorter path: If the new state `(next_k, next_x, next_y)` has not been visited yet (`min_moves[...] == -1`), it means we have found the shortest path to it.
            *   Update `min_moves[next_k][next_x + OFFSET][next_y + OFFSET] = current_moves + 1`.
            *   Enqueue the new state: `q.push({k=next_k, x=next_x, y=next_y})`.

5.  **Final Answer Calculation:**
    *   After the BFS loop terminates, iterate through all possible final coordinates `(x, y)` in the range `[-50, 50]`.
    *   Find the minimum value of `min_moves[T][x + OFFSET][y + OFFSET]` across all `x` and `y`.
    *   If this minimum value is still infinity (`-1`), it means a state with exactly `T` orbs was never reached. Output `-1`.
    *   Otherwise, output the minimum value found.

### **4. Complexity Analysis**

*   **Time Complexity:** `O(T * X_range * Y_range * N)`
    *   The BFS visits each state `(k, x, y)` at most once.
    *   The number of states is `T * X_range * Y_range`.
    *   From each state, we perform `N` transitions.
    *   With `T=5500`, `X_range=101`, `Y_range=101`, and `N=5`, this is `5500 * 101 * 101 * 5 ≈ 2.8 * 10^8` operations. While large, this is the intended complexity, and it's often feasible as many states may be unreachable in practice.

*   **Space Complexity:** `O(T * X_range * Y_range)`
    *   The space is dominated by the `min_moves` 3D array.
    *   `5501 * 101 * 101 * sizeof(int)` ≈ `225 MB`, which is acceptable under typical competitive programming memory limits (256-512 MB).

This approach is optimal because it systematically explores all reachable states in order of the number of moves, ensuring the first solution found for collecting `T` orbs is the one with the minimum number of moves, without redundant computations.
